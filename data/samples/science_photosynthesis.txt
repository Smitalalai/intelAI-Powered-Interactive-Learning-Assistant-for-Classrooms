Photosynthesis: How Plants Make Food
        
        Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. This process is essential for life on Earth as it produces the oxygen we breathe and the food that forms the base of most food chains.
        
        The Photosynthesis Equation:
        6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
        
        Key Components:
        1. Chloroplasts: Cell structures where photosynthesis occurs
        2. Chlorophyll: Green pigment that captures light energy
        3. Stomata: Tiny pores on leaves that allow gas exchange
        
        Two Main Stages:
        1. Light Reactions: Convert light energy to chemical energy
        2. Calvin Cycle: Use chemical energy to make glucose
        
        Importance:
        - Produces oxygen for all living things
        - Creates food for plants and animals
        - Removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
        - Forms the foundation of most ecosystems
        
        Factors Affecting Photosynthesis:
        - Light intensity
        - Temperature
        - Carbon dioxide concentration
        - Water availability
