Introduction to Algebra
        
        Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. The main purpose of algebra is to find unknown values, called variables.
        
        Key Concepts:
        1. Variables: Letters that represent unknown numbers (like x, y, z)
        2. Expressions: Combinations of variables, numbers, and operations (like 2x + 3)
        3. Equations: Mathematical statements that show two expressions are equal (like 2x + 3 = 7)
        
        Basic Operations:
        - Addition and subtraction of like terms
        - Multiplication and division of variables
        - Solving simple equations
        
        Example: If 2x + 3 = 7, then 2x = 4, so x = 2
        
        Practice Problems:
        1. Solve for x: 3x + 5 = 14
        2. Simplify: 4x + 2x - 3x
        3. If y = 2x + 1 and x = 3, what is y?
